My expectations for my journey in CMSC 100 are that I will not only improve my creativity skills in designing a website but also master the development of its backend. Additionally, this is my second time having Sir Capuchino as my lab professor, and I also expect him to be as considerate and supportive of students as he was before. He is really good at explaining topics, and I hope he continues to excel in that aspect.
